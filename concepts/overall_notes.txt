overall notes

issues
------

[1] how does a non-beveled/filleted edge look when printed in metal? what is the threshold for minimum faces before the face starts to look tesselated
[2] map a single control node value to several outputs sequentially
[3] constrain related values to disallow slider configurations that result in invalid meshes
[4] how strict is shapeways on only accepting manifold, self-intersecting meshes? what about degenerate tris?
[5] combine two morphs as inverses (0 through .5 of the parent node goes through the reverse of one, then .5 through 1 does the other forward)
[6] setting slider value ranges and properly normalizing them to internal representation

[] implement translations on vertex groups
[] implement shear on vertex groups

models to complete (order not significant)
------

hex-2layer_ring - blocked on issue [1]
warrior_ring - blocked on [2] and [3]
two-prong-triangular_ring - needs to be remeshed, figure out how to project vertices to plane
woven_ring - questionable mesh well-formedness [4]
jjones_ring - pretty much done, requires [2]
keyhole_ring - looks simple (is this the spec jjones implemented?) blocks on [2]
two-bar-shift - looks like an extremely simple mesh, needs to be rebuilt from scratch quickly
spike_bracelet - looks good, depends on [5] before we can publish (without a dozen extra sliders, at least)
flowing_ring - simply needs to be rebuilt, looks like it would only take an hour or 2

(image_list) -
easy - 8
hard - 3
hard now, easy with wires - 1
hard corner check - 1
requires csg - 1

mostly done (could be improved)
------

bar ring - could represent all the cube morphs as per-group scale factors in each axis, could also improve the topology around the connection to the prism
mirror no hole - originally modelled as tris, might not have a great hires
offset extruded - seems fine, pretty simple
parted - could represent the morphs as shears and translations to save memory
open-trapezoid_bracelet - could probably be hewn closer to andrew's specifications
regular-shapes_ring - 4 simple geometric shape rings, supposed to be combined into one model when the model shortage is less urgent
